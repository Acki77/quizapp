# Recap Project 1: Quiz App - Layout

In this project you will build the layout of your first mobile web application, a quiz app. In later projects we will expand this app and add all sorts of cool functionality.

Overview
In this project we will have 3 pages:

- **Home page:** Here, you’ll have access to view all questions available on the platform.
- **Bookmark page**: This is a dedicated space where you can exclusively view the questions you’ve bookmarked, similar to the ones marked on the home page.
- **Profile page**: This section allows you to view and manage your profile and settings.
  Explore these topic ideas for your quiz app or choose your own, avoiding placeholder text.
